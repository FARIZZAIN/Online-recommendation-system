Welcome to the Basic Online Retail Recommendation System repository! This project focuses on implementing a straightforward recommendation system using scikit-learn's collaborative filtering techniques, with a primary emphasis on user-based collaborative filtering.

Key Features:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: This recommendation system leverages the power of user-based collaborative filtering to suggest products to users based on the preferences and purchase history of similar users. If you've just bought a product, the system identifies users with similar purchase patterns and recommends products they have purchased.

Scikit-learn Implementation: The project utilizes scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, for building the recommendation model. Scikit-learn's simplicity and effectiveness make it an ideal choice for implementing a basic yet functional recommendation system.

Straightforward Setup: The repository is structured for ease of use. With clear instructions and a user-friendly interface, you can quickly set up and run the recommendation system on your dataset.

Customization: Although designed as a basic recommendation system, the code is modular and can be customized to incorporate more advanced features or different collaborative filtering techniques based on your specific requirements.
